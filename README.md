## Why?

As developers ourselves, we understand the importance of having a strong community to support and guide us in our programming journey. Discord is a popular platform for developers to connect and collaborate, but finding the right community can be a challenge. That's why I want to make it easier for developers to discover programming languages and their respective Discord community servers.
